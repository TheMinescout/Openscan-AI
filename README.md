# 🔍 OpenScan-AI: The One-Shot Coding Battle

A web-based document and object scanning application built entirely through "One-Shot" AI generation. This project compares the architectural and creative capabilities of the world's most advanced AI models.

## ⚔️ The Challenge
Each AI model was given a single, complex prompt to create a fully functional, single-file HTML5 scanning app. No human bug fixes, no follow-up prompts, and no external assets allowed (other than CDNs).

### The Contenders:
* **Gemini 3.0 Thinking** (Google)
* **GPT-5** (OpenAI)
* **Claude 4.6 Extended** (Anthropic) - *Awaiting Results*

## 🚀 Features (Targeted)
* **Live Viewfinder:** Real-time camera stream with scanning overlays.
* **Glassmorphism UI:** A sleek, modern dark-themed interface.
* **OCR Integration:** Text recognition powered by Tesseract.js.
* **Image Processing:** High-contrast filters for document clarity.
* **Exporting:** PDF generation and clipboard support.

## 📂 Repository Structure
* `/gemini.html`: The raw output from Gemini 3.0 Thinking.
* `/gpt.html`: The raw output from GPT-5.
* `/claude.html`: The raw output from Claude 4.6 (Coming Soon).
* `/index.html`: The "Perfected Version" (Human-optimized).
